# Mat+

This is a lightweight linear algebra tool developed by a freshman in SJTU， which can be used to do matrix operations， solve linear equations and find out the inversion and determinant of matrics, or somrthing like that.

Later, we may provide further functions to prove its performance in solving complicated problems.

# Instructions
